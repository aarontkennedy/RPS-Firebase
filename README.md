This is a Rock Paper Scissors game that lets players play other people that visit the site.
Sign in and if there are other people signed in, you will be automatically matched up to play Rock Paper Scissors.
Google Firebase is used as a database to store and communicate.  

The implementation is one giant game object.  I thought this was easier for me mentally since I could write the necessary code to start listening for events, but then at the same time write any clean up code.  Just easier to keep track of resources.  Also, use a quasi state machine to keep track of the state of the game.
